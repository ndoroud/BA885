# Advanced Analytics II (BA885)

This repository contains the course materials for the Advanced Analytics II course first offered in Spring 2022 at 
Boston University's [Questrom School of Business](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/).

Assuming familiarity with the basics of Deep Larning using Keras/TensorFlow, we delve deeper into various aspects
of Deep Learning using a very hands-on approach. The original notebooks can be found in the 
[v1_Spring_2022](https://github.com/ndoroud/BA885/tree/master/v1_spring_2022) folder.

The course takes a modular approach to model building with Keras and TensorFlow. The tutorials are thus desiged to
familiarize the students with piecing together blocks/modules to build more complex neural network architechtures.

Some of the topics covered are
- Transfer Learning
- Ensembling
- Transformers
- Generative models
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
